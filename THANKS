This package owes a huge thanks to the R core team for developing the
postscript font metric code in the core grDevices library (copied in
this package in the "src/ps_fonts.h" file) and including AFM files as
a standard part of an R installation.  Without these files, this
package would not provide font metrics and the excellent plotmath
capabilities of R would be unusable with the emf output device.
