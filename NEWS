v3.6-1 -- 22 May 2018
  -emphasize inability to embed fonts in help page
  -attempt to fix compiler error on certain newer OSX systems

v3.6 -- 21 July 2017
  -for rotated text in EMF (as opposed to EMF+), insert rotation into
   font specification rather than using world transform.  This change
   makes for more ungainly files but greater compatibility with
   viewing programs that only support a subset of the EMF specification.
  -fix roundoff error when calculating page size in micrometers (in
   EMF header; unclear if used by any viewing program)

v3.5 -- 8 June 2017
  -implement clipping at EMF/EMF+ level (previously relied on R to
   clip, which is more aggressive, particularly with regard to text,
   and led to difference between EMF output vs. other devices)
  -only issue select object command for EMF font immediately before writing
   text (previously issued when first requested font metrics, which was not
   necessary)
  -change EMF world rotation commands to avoid depending on
   SAVE/RESTORE DC (which is unclear from spec whether it is supposed
   to save world rotation state).  This change avoids a bug triggered
   when printing figures with rotated text in Word 2010 (Thanks to
   Philip Harslett for reporting)

v3.4 -- 7 April 2017
  -add option for user to specify DPI used when setting up device
   coordinate system.  Previously was fixed at one dot per 0.01mm (aka
   2540 DPI; 0.01mm units are used elsewhere by EMF), but some lazy
   EMF clients appear to render the image as a bitmap of size equal to
   inches * DPI.. which can lead to out of memory errors.  Changing
   default to be 300 DPI.
  -fix handling of miter limit for miter-type line joins in EMF+ files.
  -correct R_init_* registration entrypoint name
  -use registered R symbol as entrypoint in .External call
  -fix PROTECT error (thanks to Tomas Kalibera's tool for identifying)

v3.3-1 -- 10 Feb 2017
  -fix edge case on linux where both Xft and zlib are installed but a
   connection cannot be made to the X server (i.e., if running R from
   ssh session without forwarding X connections)
  -add cleanup script

v3.3 -- 9 Feb 2017
  -fix additional Solaris compiler errors & warnings
  -add OSX linker option "-framework CoreText", which allows the
   devEMF shared library to be loaded separately from standard R (and
   hence pass cran checks).
  -fix memory leak in EMF font handling (EMF+ was ok)
  -fix memory leak in Windows GDI font metric code
  -fix minor memory leak in Linux font metric code

v3.2 -- 19 Sept 2016
  -add raster image support
  -embed devEMF version number in EMF output (in a comment field)
  -rework text output to use world transformations
  -bug fixes related to path rendering
  -eliminate compiler errors on Solaris C++98 compiler

v3.1 -- 17 Mar 2016
  -add back ability to use Adobe font metric (AFM) files, in case no
   graphical interface (Xft, Windows, Apple) is available to query.
   Adobe distributes AFMs for the 14 core PDF fonts, and these are now
   included in the devEMF package (note before v2.0, devEMF accessed
   the AFMs included in the grDevices package).  To keep this package
   size managable, the AFMs are gzipped, so using this ability
   requires zlib.
  -add support for path rendering

v3.0 -- 3 Apr 2015
  -add support for EMF+ output.  This format has less complete support
   in client programs but allows for partial transparency.  EMF+
   output is now the default, but the pure EMF output is still
   possible with an option to the "emf()" call that opens the device.

v2.0 -- 29 Jan 2015
  -switch to platform-specific font metric code instead of accessing
   the AFM files supplied with core R via a non-public R API (this
   previous approach violated CRAN policy).  The primary downside is
   that the new code will not operate on non-OSX, non-Windows
   platforms unless X windows is installed along with the Xft
   development headers.  It should work on OSX and Windows out of the
   box; please contact me if you have trouble (I primarily work on
   linux).
  -bug fix: EMF polygon record had potential rounding mismatch between
   vertex coordinates and bounding box coordinates.
  -bug fix: when PS_NULL, set pen BS_NULL (although seems unnecessary
   in practice)

v1.2-1  --  18 Feb 2013
  - Bug fix: EMF custom line types not working properly for solid
    lines. (Thanks to Nis Martensen for reporting and patching)

v1.2  --  22 Feb 2012
  - Bug fix: TextUTF8 used incorrect vertical alignment. (Thanks to
    Jared Decker for reporting)
  - change yLineBias to be 0.2 for compatibility with R >= 2.14

v1.1  --  6 Feb 2012
  - Add support for different line end and join styles. (Thanks to
    Mathias Walter for suggesting)

v1.0-1
  - Amend help to mention that partial transparency is not supported
    by the EMF format

v1.0
  - Been using for 6mo with no problems; bump version to 1.
  - Replace remaining few uses of printf with Rprintf

v0.9-4
  - Placed package within NAMESPACE (in prep for R-2.14.0)
  - modified ps_fonts.h to make compatible with R-2.14.0 revised
    handling of gzip i/o
