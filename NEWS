v2.0 -- 29 Jan 2015
  -switch to platform-specific font metric code instead of accessing
   the AFM files supplied with core R via a non-public R API (this
   previous approach violated CRAN policy).  The primary downside is
   that the new code will not operate on non-OSX, non-Windows
   platforms unless X windows is installed along with the Xft
   development headers.  It should work on OSX and Windows out of the
   box; please contact me if you have trouble (I primarily work on
   linux).
  -bug fix: EMF polygon record had potential rounding mismatch between
   vertex coordinates and bounding box coordinates.
  -bug fix: when PS_NULL, set pen BS_NULL (although seems unnecessary
   in practice)
